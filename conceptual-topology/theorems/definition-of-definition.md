# The definition of definition
```
Let C be a conceptual category.
Let A,B∈Ob(C) and R be a rupture condition (contrast frame Z).

If:
∀Δt→0, ∄f∈C(A,B∣R) such that f is invertible and f≅f′ under continuous homeo-transformation
Then:
A is definable in C under rupture frame R as A = {–B} | Δt

Definition (Temporal Identity Stability):
concept A is said to be Δt-stable if any morphism g: A → A′ | Z (continuity) satisfies g ≈ idₐ within Δt

※ f ≅ f′ under continuous homeo-transformation
 f: the difference between Hisamatsu Midori-shijimi and Mesuaka Midori-shijimi
 f′: another within-species variation (e.g., a fluctuation in wing pattern)

If f ≅ f′, then both differences can be continuously transformed into one another without breaking the underlying species structure of Midori-shijimi.
