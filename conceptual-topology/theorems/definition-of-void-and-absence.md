# Definition of Void (Non-Existence)

An object A is considered to be void (i.e., both undefined and nonexistent) 
if it satisfies all of the following conditions::

1. ∀Δt→0, ∃f∈C(A,B∣Z) such that f is invertible
2. μ(A):=Δt→ϵlim[∃Z:C(A_t, A_t+Δt, Z) is stable] = 0
3. Neutral

### Definition of Quasi-Existence ("Not There")
An object A is said to be in a state of quasi-existence (i.e., "not there") if it satisfies only condition μ(A)>0, but not condition 1:

For example, the statement “There is no cup on the desk” satisfies μ(A) > 0
(i.e., the concept "cup" exists in contrast frame Z such as your memory)
but it fails condition 1, because no differentiable structure allows us to identify the cup on the desk. Therefore, it is absent as visual information within the contrast frame Z.


1. Theorem of Non-Existence under Full Invertibility
If, for any temporal slice Δt, only invertible morphisms exist between any two objects A and B, then neither A nor B is considered to exist:

That is, when all morphisms f ∈ C(A, B | Z) are invertible for all Δt → 0,
A and B become indistinguishable under the contrast frame Z.
In such a case, the differential structure required to define either object fails to emerge,
and thus neither A nor B can be said to exist.

```
Let a space be S
Sn = GenCategoryWith1Morphism(S) = { Cn1, C_n2 …. C_n} // Generate Categories
Let assume A, B ⊂ Si
A = {-B} and B = {-A}

if :
∀Δt→0, ∃f∈C(A,B∣Z) such that f is invertible

then:
id_x = A → B = B → A | Z　

But:
This implies A≈B∣Z, which contradicts A={−B}, B={−A}

Therefore:
A and B do not exist as definable, distinguishable entities under Z
```

2. Void Through the Absence of Stable Structure
if:
μ(A):=Δt→ϵlim[∃Z:C(A_t, A_t+Δt, Z) is stable] = 0
then:
No structurally preserved difference (i.e., continuity of contrast) exists across time.


3. The Identity Element as Void
We interpret the identity element as a form of void:

A ⊕ Neutral = A

The object Neutral exhibits no generative or interfering behavior with respect to semantic morphisms or structural transformations.

It remains entirely inert—neither altering nor producing any meaningful change in the structure of A.

In this sense, Neutral functions as a conceptual void: structurally present, but semantically absent.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  void* a;  // void* is Neutral ⇒ invertible 
            //μ(a)=0 since a has no morpic identity; Z is undefined
  printf(*a); // Segmentation fault (core dumped)
}
```
