### the assymetry creates difference
if A given meets C(A, B∣R) > θ and μ(A) > 0, A ≈ id_A 

Let node_a be A
Let node_b be B
A = {-B} and B = {-A} 
If:∀Δt→0, ∄f∈C(A, B∣R) > θ such that f is invertible and f≅f′ under continuous homeo-transformation
Then:
μ(A):=Δt→ϵlim[∃Z:C(A_t, A_t+Δt, Z) is stable] > 0
∴ A ≈ id_A



### how category emerges
Let C₀ be a category-genesis.
such that ∀f ∈ Mor(C₀), f is invertible under homeo-transformation.

Let R be a rupture condition (the cause of asymmetry)
s.t. ∃f: A → B in C₀ with no f⁻¹ satisfying structure-preserving conditions.

Then:
C₀ splits into two subcategories C₁ and C₂
such that: f ∈ C(C₁, C₂), but f⁻¹ ∉ C(C₂, C₁)

Define:
F: C₀ → C₁ as a functor capturing irreversible emergence of structure
C₁, C₂⊂ C₀

I generalize this
Cn1, C_n2 …. C_n⊂ C_n-1

Let C₀ be a category-genesis,
such that ∀f ∈ Mor(C₀), f is invertible under homeo-transformation.
