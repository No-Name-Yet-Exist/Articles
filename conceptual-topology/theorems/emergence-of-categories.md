# the process of the category emergence

### Theorem of Definitional Existence

### the assymetry creates difference
if  Given A meets C(A, B ∣ R) > θ and μ(A) > 0, A ≈ id_A 

This was tested with a rupture modeling with python.

In HoTT, identity is defined by the existence of a path (homotopy).
In CT, we reinterpret such paths as morphisms under structural continuity (Z): morphic identity preserved through morphic path. The rupture condition R characterizes asymmetry where such paths fail. Thus, identity in CT is not an invariable equality, but a conditionally preserved morphic alignment defined via temporal stability (μ) and contextual continuity (Z).


```
Let node_a be A
Let node_b be B
A = {-B} and B = {-A} 

// HoTT-style inequivalence A ≠ B
If:∀Δt→0, ∄f∈C(A, B∣R) > θ such that f is invertible and f≅f′ under continuous homeo-transformation
Then:
//HoTT-style equivalence A = A′
μ(A):=Δt→ϵlim[∃Z:C(A_t, A_t+Δt, Z) is stable] > 0

//preserved morphic identity under temporal continuity with frame Z
∴ A ≈ id_A
```



### how category emerges

```
Let C₀ be a category-genesis.
such that ∀f ∈ Mor(C₀), f is invertible under homeo-transformation.

Let R be a rupture condition (the cause of asymmetry)
s.t. ∃f: A → B in C₀ with no f⁻¹ satisfying structure-preserving conditions.

Then:
C₀ splits into two subcategories C₁ and C₂
such that: f ∈ C(C₁, C₂), but f⁻¹ ∉ C(C₂, C₁)

Define:
F: C₀ → C₁ as a functor capturing irreversible emergence of structure
C₁, C₂⊂ C₀

I generalize this
Cn1, C_n2 …. C_n⊂ C_n-1

Let C₀ be a category-genesis,
such that ∀f ∈ Mor(C₀), f is invertible under homeo-transformation.
