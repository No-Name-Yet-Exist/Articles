# Semantic Identity Collapse under Perfect Invertibility 

Definition: Morphic Opposition and Local Reconstructibility in Conceptual Space

Let a concept C be defined as a set of semantic morphisms:
C={a⃗1,a⃗2,...,a⃗n}


This aligns with Yoneda’s Lemma, which states that for any object A in a category C, and any functor F:C→Set,
Nat(Hom(–,A),F)≅F(A)

This formulation supports the construction of morphic oppositional pairs, such as:
A={−B},B={−A}

Note: This relation does not imply strict logical negation. Rather, it denotes a morphic oppositional structure in which concept A is semantically embedded as an opposition to concept B, and vice versa.

This oppositional embedding provides the structural basis for differential operations such as A−B, and under additive semantics, enables near-reconstruction of A:
A−(A−B)≈A(empirically: cos_sim≈0.8 in word2vec  ref: semantic-atoms.md)


# Meaning Preservation Triangle
This triangle illustrates how additive semantics reconstructs conceptual continuity.

Then black is semantically situated as “that which is inverse to white,” and this structure supports a locally reversible semantic reconstruction diagram:

```
      A
     | \
   δ |  \ r
     ↓   \
    Δ ——→ A − Δ
          ≈ A

Where:

    δ:A→Δ is a Differential Morphism (semantic contrast extraction)

    r:Δ→A is a Regen Morphism (semantic reconstruction)

    r∘δ≈idA expresses approximate identity preservation under reconstruction

```

### Local Validity and Theoretical Idealization

This morphic structure A={−B} and reconstruction equation A−(A−B)≈A do not apply universally. They hold in local, symmetric semantic spaces—such as binary or oppositional pairs (e.g., black⇔white, true⇔false)—where:

The conceptual domains are low-dimensional

Semantic contrast is tightly structured and near-invertible

Oppositional embeddings are stable across minor perturbations

In such regions, meaning behaves quasi-reversibly. Outside these zones, semantic reconstruction becomes lossy, and the structure collapses into noise or asymmetry.
Therefore we define:

A = {−B} as a theoretical symmetrical asymmetry — a structurally idealized representation of opposition that functions within locally commutative semantic diagrams, but which is not globally or universally applicable.

f: Meaning morphism (standard semantic transformation)
δ: Differential morphism — extracts Δ, the semantic difference between A and B
r: Regen morphism — applies −Δ to recover A from B
Δ: Differential — the structural difference space between A and B
