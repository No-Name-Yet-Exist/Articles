Concept C is defined as a set of semantic morphisms
C = { a₁_vec, a₂_vec, ..., aₙ_vec }

This is related to Yoneda's lemma
For any object A in a category C,
and any functor F: C → Set,
Nat(Hom(–, A), F) ≅ F(A)


# Meaning Preservation Triangle
This triangle illustrates how additive semantics reconstructs conceptual continuity.

```
A − (A − B) ≈ A

            f: A → B （black → white）
    B
    ▲
   /    \
  /        \  Δ = A − B
 /           \       
δ            ↑
 \           /
  \         /
   A <── r: −Δ


A: Initial concept
B: Target (destination) concept
A − (A − B): Restored meaning (via additive recomposition)
(experimentally, cos_sim ≈ 0.8; approximates original A)

f: Meaning morphism (standard semantic transformation)
δ: Differential morphism — extracts Δ, the semantic difference between A and B
r: Regen morphism — applies −Δ to recover A from B
Δ: Differential — the structural difference space between A and B
``` 
This supports A ={-B} and B = {-A}

Note: A = {−B} does not imply strict logical negation, but rather expresses a morphic structure where A is defined as a semantic vector space constructed in opposition to B. This oppositional embedding forms the basis for differential operations such as A − B, and under additive semantics, allows near-reconstruction of A: A − (A − B) ≈ A (empirically cos_sim ≈ 0.8 in word2vec).
