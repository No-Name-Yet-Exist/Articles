# What is Z and Morphism
We put varible Z as contituity or morphic path. However, we define it as base space using all experiences we obtained so far.

We defined Morphisms using examples, but now we can define it using formulation based on Category Theory and observation we obtained so far.

# Definition of Z
We define a concept A as:

*Fb(A)≅Nat(Hom(−,A),F)*

That is: A concept is understood as a structure of morphisms (Yoneda perspective),
and its semantic fiber Fb​ represents how this concept appears within a Z-frame,which is morphic path, b∈B


**Base Space B: Z-frame**

B is the space of continuity or morphic path
Each element b∈B is a semantic base point such as "baby", "gender", "mammal", etc.
These are not content themselves, but frames along which meanings are structurally preserved.


**Fiber Fb​: Morphic Chain**

For each b∈B, define:
*Fb=π−1(b)*

The fiber over b is the set of morphic chains that are a continuum under Z
π: girl → she → female | femenity

```
       E（Meaning Space）
      /|\   
     / | \
    /  |  \
girl  she  female
  |    |     |
  ↓    ↓     ↓
Z = "femininity"（Base Space B）



```

**Total Space E: Meaning Space**</br>
The total space of the conceptual bundle π: E → B.
We call E the *meaning space*, consisting of all conceptual transitions 
fibered over semantic base points b ∈ B (Z-frames) defined below.

Each fiber Fb represents a morphic chain structured under a specific continuity frame,
and E is their union — the total conceptual landscape.
The total space of the bundle. We call this meaning space or conceptual space.

```
   dog     human     
    |         |        
    |         |        
   puppy     girl    
    |         |        
     \__baby__/
      (base B)

Total space E = The space which includes all of this

In this diagram, the semantic base point baby provides continuity across otherwise distinct vocabularies (puppy–dog, girl–human), thereby enabling the formation of a coherent meaning space.

```

**Parallel Transport of Meaning**

*η:Fdi→Fdi | Z*
e.g. η: girl → puppy | baby
</br>


# What is Morphism in Conceptual Topology
CT has 3 levels of Morphisms.

```
previous definition:
f: A → B | R
f: A ≈ B | Z_local
f: A ~ B | Z_global

Z: variable which ensures the continuity 
R: rupture

We can redefine this as follows.
*η:Fdi→Fdi | Z*

In detail:
f: A → B | R //non-invertible projectoin
f: A ≈ B | Z_local  // invertible
f: A ~ B | Z_global // invertible
```
