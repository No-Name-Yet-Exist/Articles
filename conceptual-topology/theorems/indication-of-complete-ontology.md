# The self definition by Conceptual Topology by itself

A complete ontology must be capable of defining its own categorical structure without relying on externally invertible mappings. Conceptual Topology satisfies this condition.

Conceptual Topology is definable by its own structure if and only if it maintains structural stability under internal morphisms over time, while possessing no invertible mappings to any other theory under contrastive rupture frames.

```
Let CT be Conceptual Topology
If:
∀Δt→0, ∄f∈C(CT, other theories∣R) such that f is invertible and f≅f′ under continuous homeo-transformation
Then:
μ(CT):=Δt→ϵlim[∃Z:C(CT_t, CT_t+Δt, Z) is stable] = true
∴ CT ≈ id_CT

Let PCT be Conceptual Dynamics as proto-Conceptual Topology
PCT = M(PCT , CT ′,Z) | C(PCT , CT ′, Z) = true ∧ C(PCT, CT, PCT)= true
yet
PCT → CT | PCT
Thus ∄f∈C(CT, PCT | R)
