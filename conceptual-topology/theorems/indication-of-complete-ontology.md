# The self definition by Conceptual Topology by itself

The indication that Conceptual Topology meets the definition of Ontology, which means if the complete Ontology exists, it must be capable of defining itself.

```
Let CT be Conceptual Topology
If:
∀Δt→0, ∄f∈C(CT, other theories∣R) such that f is invertible and f≅f′ under continuous homeo-transformation
Then:
μ(CT):=Δt→ϵlim[∃Z:C(CT_t, CT_t+Δt, Z) is stable] = true
∴ CT ≈ id_CT

Let PCT be Conceptual Dynamics as proto-Conceptual Topology
PCT = M(PCT , CT ′,Z) | C(PCT , CT ′, Z) = true ∧ C(PCT, CT, PCT)= true
yet
PCT → CT | PCT
Thus ∄f∈C(CT, PCT | R)
