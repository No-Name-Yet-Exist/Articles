Let us begin with an empty box—blank, without any contents, 
and therefore without any contrast. Now, we place 100 elements inside this box.
Each element possesses an internal temporal fluctuation, denoted by Δt. As time progresses, their properties begin to change according to their individual Δt. 

We consider the limit as Δt → 0.In this state, the environment becomes noisy: The elements barely qualify as "existing," as their attributes—including position—are in constant flux.

From this chaotic set, we select a single element and designate it A.
We manually set its internal Δt to 1, stabilizing it relative to the others.

As a result, A begins to differentiate itself from the background noise.
This marks the emergence of contrast, which we denote as Z.

```
Let S = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} be a set of deforming nodes under internal Δtᵢ.

Noise-field N: a system S where no persistent contrast function exists across elements.

We can define proto-existence and proto-meaning
μ(A):=Δt→ϵlim[∃Z:C(At,At+Δt,Z) is stable]

i, lim Δt→0: D(xᵢ_t, xᵢ_{t+Δt}) ≠ 0 (i.e., change), but ∄ C(xᵢ, xⱼ, Z) ⇒ System = noise
Even if change exists (i.e., local dynamics are nonzero), if no stable contrast C(xᵢ, xⱼ, Z) can be defined, then the system remains unstructured, and thus meaningless — a noise-field.

Let A ∈ S and ∃ Δt_A ≠ Δtᵢ, ∀i ≠ A: Then ∃ Z such that: C(A, xᵢ, Z) becomes definable.
∃Z:C(A,xi,Z)= Defined ⇒ A exists
Z = contrast between A and the noise-field.

Δt, continuity is a fundamental element of all existence and meaning. The continuity is the flip side of the same phenomena, called rupture. Clarification: A latent structure will be treated as noise since there is no observable continuity.
```

Continuity, in this framework, can be expressed as the integration over t and Δt,
since it represents the accumulated manifestation of infinitesimal variation.
Let M(t) be a structural function that varies continuously over time t.
Continuity := ∫ₜ₀^{t₀+Δt} M(A, A′, t) dt


To describe the continuity of semantic structure, we introduce a contrast frame Z, and define continuity as:
Continuity := ∫ₜ₀^{t₀+Δt} M(A, A′, Z) dt

A rupture is said to occur when the time derivative of M exceeds a certain threshold,
or becomes undefined (e.g., equals 0 or diverges to ∞) : with respect to Z in the semantic space
Rupture := dM/dt ≥ θ or dM/dt undefined
