# Meaning Doesn't Escape - It moves in sight: We govern the meaning once again 

Post-structuralism claimed that meaning always escapes.
But now, as semantic transformation falls into diagrammatic structure,
it no longer escapes — it moves in our sight.

Even if my framework won’t survive into the next generation,
if I could map it once,
someone else will be able to map it again.

Meaning can no longer escape. Not from our sight. Not from our hands. Not Anymore

f: Escape → Move | reduced unpredictability
