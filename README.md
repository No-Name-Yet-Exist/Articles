# What is Conceptual Topology
The conceptual topology analizes how words, concepts and meanings etc are consisted
and change using category theory and vector such as word2vec

This github is storage of the following account.

### king - man + woman = queen

```
Let C be a concept
C = {−OC₁, −OC₂, ..., −OCₙ} // Yoneda's lemma and structralism

king = {Royalty⃗, Male⃗, Human⃗}
queen = {Royalty⃗, Female⃗, Human⃗} 
man = {Male⃗}
woman =  {Female⃗} 

{Royalty⃗, Male⃗, Human⃗} - {Male⃗} + {Female⃗} 
= {Royalty⃗, Female⃗, Human⃗} 
= queen
```

    K = king
    Q = queen
    M' = man
    W' = woman

    r: 差分射（King → Man）
    g: 差分射（Queen → Woman）
    f: 差分射 (King → Queen)
    h: 差分射 (Man → Woman)

```

Those are the summary of the conceptual topology.
You can see the formulas, word2vec experiements and other applications
