### category theory to NL (natural langauge)
This analizes how we avoided the issues created when we apply category theory to NL.</br>

### symbols-terminologies
This provides the systematical connection between Category Theory and Conceptual Topology.
e.g. the definition of Object or other terminologies such as Z or morphic path.</br>

# Theorems

### Definition of Object/Concept
Why are the objects and concepts expressed as C = { a₁_vec, a₂_vec, ..., aₙ_vec }
or A = {-B} and B = {-A} in Conceptual Topology.</br>
https://github.com/No-Name-Yet-Exist/Articles/blob/main/conceptual-topology/theorems/definition-of-object-concept.md

</br>

### Self-Definability Theorem
A complete ontology must be capable of defining its own categorical structure without relying on externally invertible mappings. Conceptual Topology satisfies this condition.</br>
https://github.com/No-Name-Yet-Exist/Articles/blob/main/conceptual-topology/theorems/self-definability-theorem.md

</br>

### definition of definition
Definition is the criterion by which the shared identity between implicitly unified entities B and C — subsumed within an undifferentiated higher-order structure A — is ruptured.</br>
https://github.com/No-Name-Yet-Exist/Articles/blob/main/conceptual-topology/theorems/definition-of-definition.md

</br>

### emergence of existence
An entity is said to exist under a contrast frame Z
if there is a stable morphic continuity preserved across a temporal interval Δt,
even if the entity itself is not a continuous object.</br>

In formal terms:
μ(A) := lim Δt→ε [∃Z : C(Aₜ, Aₜ₊Δt, Z) is stable] > 0
⇒ A exists (under frame Z)</br>

https://github.com/No-Name-Yet-Exist/Articles/blob/main/conceptual-topology/theorems/definition-of-existence.md

</br>

### definition of void and absence
When do we say that there is no cup on the desk?
We say so when no differentiable structure corresponding to the concept "cup" exists within the frame of the desk.</br>
https://github.com/No-Name-Yet-Exist/Articles/blob/main/conceptual-topology/theorems/definition-of-void-and-absence.md

</br>

### emergence of category
A new category Cᵢ (and subsequently Cᵢ₊₁) emerges when the complete symmetry of the initial category C₀ is broken — that is, when a morphism f: A → B appears such that f is non-invertible,
and thus A ≉ B under any structure-preserving transformation. </br>

# Empirical Applications

### Word2Vec x Python Experiments
Conceptual Topology is tested with Word2Vec and Python Script.
We provide with the code and the used data set written in word2vec.md</br>

### applications
We provide example use cases of Conceptual Topology.</br>
